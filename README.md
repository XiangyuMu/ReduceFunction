# ReduceFunction
1. The 70 reduce functions with commutatity are stored in ./Commutative;
2. 100 reduce functions stored in ./Non-commutative and they are classified into five patterns;
3. The folder ./Test case set store the test case set for each non-commutative functions.
4. The file "result statistic.xlsx" records our experiment result.
5. the folder ./ReliableVariableExtraction contains the code of extraction reliable variables from reduce functions.
6. the folder ./TestCasesSetGeneration contains the code of generate the test cases set.
